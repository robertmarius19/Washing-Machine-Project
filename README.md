# Washing-Machine-Project
This project implements a washing machine control system that operates in both manual and automatic modes. The system allows users to select washing parameters such as temperature, speed, pre-wash, and extra rinse. The control logic is implemented using hardware components like ROM, counters, multiplexers, and SSD controllers.
